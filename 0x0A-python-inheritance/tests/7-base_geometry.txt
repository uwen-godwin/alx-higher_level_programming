This is a test file for the BaseGeometry class.

The BaseGeometry class is expected to have the following behavior:

1. Create an instance of BaseGeometry.
2. Attempt to call the area() method, which should raise an exception.

Test Case:

Create a BaseGeometry instance:
>>> base_geometry = BaseGeometry()

Attempt to call the area() method:
>>> base_geometry.area()
[Exception] area() is not implemented
