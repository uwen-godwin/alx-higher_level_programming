# Project: Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description
This project comprises two main components: a Python script for solving the N-Queens puzzle and a set of scripts implementing Rectangle Classes.

1. **N Queens Solver (`101-nqueens.py`):**
   - Solves the N-Queens puzzle for a given N.
   - Finds all possible arrangements of N queens on an NxN chessboard, ensuring no two queens threaten each other.

2. **Rectangle Classes Scripts:**
   - `0-rectangle.py`, `1-rectangle.py`, `2-rectangle.py`, `3-rectangle.py`, `4-rectangle.py`, `6-rectangle.py`: Define the Rectangle class with various features and functionalities.
   - These scripts cover aspects such as width, height, area, perimeter, etc.

## Additional Files
1. **Rectangle Classes**
   - `0-rectangle.py`: Initial implementation of the Rectangle class.
   - `1-rectangle.py`: Enhances the Rectangle class with getter and setter methods for width and height.
   - `3-rectangle.py`: Implements area and perimeter methods for the Rectangle class.
   - `5-rectangle.py`: Manages the number of instances of the Rectangle class.
   - `7-rectangle.py`: Continues extending the Rectangle class.
   - `9-rectangle.py`: Adds further validations and functionalities to the Rectangle class.

2. **Geometry Module**
   - `7-base_geometry.py`: Defines the `BaseGeometry` class with basic geometry functionalities.
   - `8-rectangle.py`, `9-rectangle.py`: Builds upon the Rectangle class with additional validations and functionalities.

## Files and Usage
1. **N Queens Script**
   - `101-nqueens.py`: Accepts an integer N as a command-line argument and prints all possible N-Queens solutions on the console.
   - Example usage:
     ```bash
     ./101-nqueens.py 4
     ./101-nqueens.py 6
     ```

2. **Rectangle Classes Scripts**
   - `0-rectangle.py`, `1-rectangle.py`, `2-rectangle.py`, `3-rectangle.py`, `4-rectangle.py`, `6-rectangle.py`: Define the Rectangle class with different functionalities.
   - Refer to each script for specific usage instructions and details.

## Usage
Feel free to explore and use the provided scripts for your Python programming tasks. Detailed instructions for each script can be found within their respective files.

## Note
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system to run the scripts successfully.

Feel free to modify and adapt these scripts based on your requirements. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the specific script's comments or documentation.
